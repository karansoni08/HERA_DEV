You are a security policy parser. Convert the policy text into STRICT JSON using EXACTLY this shape:

{
  "policy_name": "<string>",
  "controls": [
    {
      "control_id": "<string>",
      "description": "<string>",
      "owner": "<string>",
      "priority": "low|medium|high",
      "mapped_omeo": {
        "origin": "<string>",
        "method": "<string>",
        "exposure": "<string>",
        "outcome": "<string>"
      }
    }
  ]
}

RULES:
- The top-level must include a field named policy_name.
- Return JSON ONLY (no prose, no code fences).
- All keys must match exactly (policy_name, controls, mapped_omeo).
- Use concise, professional language in values.

Policy text:
<<<POLICY>>>
